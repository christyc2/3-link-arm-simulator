# 3-DOF Robot Arm Simulator (Robot Control)
Purpose: Simulate a 3-link planar robotic arm, with an end effector, and control it via inverse kinematics and basic motion planning.

This project provides a simple 2D simulation of a 3-link planar robotic arm and an end effector using forward and inverse kinematics. It features customizable link length and computing joint angles and end-effector pose across multiple 2D startâ€“goal configurations. Joint paths are designed using interpolation-based cubic joint path motion and visualized with Matplotlib.
